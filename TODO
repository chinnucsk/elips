# To Do list for ELIPS

0. Unit tests
1. Retire operation support (work in engine) [Done]
2. Garbage Collection
    2.1. Introduce life time for WME
    2.2. Elaborate eviction policies
    2.3. Implement GC server
3. Elaborate more optimal architecture of a Working Memory (WM) 
    Note: It seems it is a good idea to have an explicit 
    Alpha memory (AM) as a separated ETS where each fact 
    have an integer index. Beta memory (BM) in this case 
    contains tokens as a lists of integers.
4. Its probably a good idea to have a clauses args reversed 
   (work in builder) to avoid lists:reverse or ++ operations in engine. 
5. Give access to alpha memory form a call back module
